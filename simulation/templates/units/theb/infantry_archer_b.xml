    <History>Archers in Greece were not very numerous and their bows tended to be very simple and short-ranged. They came from the lower classes of a Greek polis and could not afford the armor and weaponry typical of a middle-class hoplite. Some archers did wear light armor of the linen and leather variety and simple inexpensive non-plumed bronze helmets.</History>
